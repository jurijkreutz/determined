# Determined - Productivity Tracking & Garden Growth System

## Project Overview

Determined is a productivity tracking application built with Next.js, React 19, MongoDB, and TailwindCSS. The application helps users track their daily activities and visualize their productivity through a unique "Grow-a-Garden" metaphor where productivity levels are represented by different plant emojis.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.3.5, React 19, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 4
- **Language**: TypeScript

## Core Features

1. **Activity Tracking**: Log predefined or custom activities with point values
2. **Grow-a-Garden**: Visualize productivity with plant emojis based on daily point totals
3. **Streak Management**: Track consecutive productive days
4. **Mystery Quests**: Daily challenges with point rewards
5. **Calendar View**: Monthly and weekly views of productivity garden

## Component Breakdown

### Main Page Components

- **page.tsx**: Main application page that assembles all components
- **layout.tsx**: Root layout with global structure

### Activity System

- **ActivityForm.tsx**: Form for adding predefined or custom activities
- **ActivityList.tsx**: Displays logged activities for a given day
- **predefinedActivities.ts**: Contains definitions of all predefined activities with point values

### Garden & Streak System

- **GardenEmoji.tsx**: Displays appropriate plant emoji based on day's points
- **MonthCalendar.tsx**: Calendar view with garden emojis for each day
- **StreakDisplay.tsx**: Shows current streak status and messages
- **gardenUtils.ts**: Utility functions for garden/streak management

### Mystery Quest System

- **MysteryQuestCard.tsx**: Displays daily mystery quest
- **mysteryQuests.ts**: Contains all possible mystery quests

### UI Components

- **Snackbar.tsx**: Toast notification component
- **DayDetailsPopup.tsx**: Popup showing day details
- **AboutBox.tsx**: Information about the application

## API Routes

### Activities API

- **GET /api/activities**: Retrieves activities for a specific date
- **POST /api/activities**: Creates a new activity
- **GET /api/activities/week**: Gets activity data for the current week

### Garden API

- **GET /api/garden**: Gets garden data for a specific date or range
- **POST /api/garden/sync**: Syncs garden data for a date
  
## Data Models

### Activities

The application uses several activity models:

- **PredefinedActivity**: Template for an activity (id, name, category, points, etc.)
- **UserActivity**: Recorded instance of an activity with timestamp
- **DailyActivityCount**: Tracks how many times each activity was performed in a day

### Garden

- **GardenDayData**: Daily garden status with points, emoji, streak info

## Core Mechanics

### Points System

- Activities have different point values based on difficulty
- Some activities have diminishing returns (75%, 50%)
- Daily caps limit how many times certain activities can be logged

### Garden Growth

Based on daily point totals:
- **ðŸŒ± Seedling**: â‰¤ 50 points (Rest/light day)
- **ðŸŒ¿ Sprout**: 51-80 points (Maintenance day)
- **ðŸŒ¸ Bloom**: 81-110 points (Productive day)
- **ðŸŒ³ Young tree**: 111-130 points (Peak day)
- **ðŸŒ´ Big palm**: >130 points (Exceptional day)

### Streak Management

- Productive days require â‰¥51 points
- Streaks pause after 2 consecutive low-point days
- Streaks reset after 3 consecutive low-point days
- Recovery activities can protect streaks on low-point days

### Mystery Quests

- Daily randomized challenges with varying difficulty levels (ðŸŸ¢, ðŸŸ¡, ðŸ”´)
- Completing quests rewards additional points

## How Components Connect

1. **Main Page Flow**: 
   - `page.tsx` integrates all main components
   - Activities feed into the garden visualization

2. **Activity System Flow**:
   - `ActivityForm` â†’ POST to `/api/activities` â†’ Database â†’ `ActivityList` (refresh)
   - Points update â†’ `GardenEmoji` update

3. **Garden System Flow**:
   - Activities generate points â†’ `gardenUtils` calculates emoji and streak status
   - `GardenEmoji` displays appropriate plant
   - `MonthCalendar` shows monthly garden progress
   - `StreakDisplay` shows current streak status

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up MongoDB:
   - Create a MongoDB Atlas account or use a local MongoDB instance
   - Add your MongoDB URI to `.env.local`

3. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Access the application at http://localhost:3000
